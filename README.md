# Restaurant-recommendation-system

# Description:
A restaurant recommendation system suggests restaurants to users based on:

User preferences (e.g., cuisine type, budget, location)

Restaurant features (e.g., cuisine, ambiance, location)

In this project, we’ll build a restaurant recommendation system using content-based filtering, where we recommend restaurants based on the features of the restaurant and the user’s preferences.

# ✅ What It Does:
* Uses TF-IDF to convert restaurant features and the user profile into numerical features

* Computes cosine similarity to measure how similar the user’s dining preferences are to each restaurant

* Recommends top restaurants based on content similarity between the user’s profile and restaurant features
